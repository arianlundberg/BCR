### Written by ARIAN LUNDBERG 
All R codes (R statistical software version 4.1.0) to reproduce the main figures of "B cell-related gene signature and cancer immunotherapy response" by Lundberg et al. are available in the "~/RCodes/" directory. 


The functions.R file contains the required and created functions, and the Main-figures.R file can be run to generate all of the main figures of the manuscript. 

**Please note that the RData files used in the codes are available on Dropbox due to the limitation of file sizes on Github**

All data derived from the public cohorts of META-BRCA, META-CRC, META-NSCLC, and META-SKCM are saved in the corresponding RData files, respectively. 

The sig.gene.RData file contains all significant genes from interaction analyses and genes included in the B cell-related gene signature.
